# Secret-Books

Welcome to **Secret-Books**! This repository is a collection of **vintage and classic books** in the field of **Computer Science**. All of these books are **70+ years old** and provide valuable insights into the foundations of computing, algorithms, software engineering, and other essential topics in the field. In addition to the books themselves, some of them also contain **project files** that showcase hands-on applications of the concepts discussed within the texts.

While the current collection primarily focuses on **Computer Science knowledge**, **more diverse topics** will be added in the near future. Expect to see a growing range of subjects including but not limited to:

* **Mathematics**
* **Engineering**
* **Physics**
* **Philosophy** (especially in relation to computing)
* **Artificial Intelligence** (historical perspectives)
* **Software Development & Project Management**

## Overview

This repository is a work in progress, and the goal is to preserve and make accessible some of the most important works from the early days of Computer Science. The books included here are invaluable resources for anyone looking to explore the origins of the field, dive deep into the theoretical underpinnings of modern computing, or simply appreciate the efforts of pioneers in the industry.

### Current Contents

At the moment, the books in this repository are all focused on **Computer Science** topics and range from fundamental concepts to more advanced subjects. These books were written in the mid-20th century, offering a unique historical perspective on the evolution of computing and the key ideas that have shaped the industry.

Each book is carefully curated and often includes accompanying **project files**, providing the reader with the opportunity to not only read the theoretical material but also implement practical applications of the concepts.

### Project Files

Several of the books in this collection come with **project files** that demonstrate the application of the material presented within. These project files may include:

* **Code samples**
* **Diagrams**
* **Project documentation**
* **Hands-on tutorials**

These files are included to help you gain a deeper understanding of the books and practice the concepts on real-world problems. They are invaluable for learning and experimenting with the old methodologies in modern environments.

### What to Expect in the Future

This repository is still expanding! While the current focus is primarily on **Computer Science**, we are soon adding books from a variety of other fields. Over time, expect a broader collection that spans the following areas:

* **Mathematics**: From the early works of algebra and calculus to more modern topics like set theory and number theory.
* **Engineering**: Including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and even early works on systems design and hardware architecture.
* **Physics**: Foundational texts that shaped the understanding of physics and its intersection with technology.
* **Philosophy**: Works exploring the relationship between humans and machines, the ethics of artificial intelligence, and early thoughts on computation and logic.
